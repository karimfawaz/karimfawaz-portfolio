                    *draft*  Hey there! Iâ€™m Karim Fawaz. I am a second year student at Queen Mary, University of London studying Computer Science BSc. I am an ambitious software developer and my dream is to start my own technology firm, Brain 2.0. Finding solutions really motivates me and I always try to improve my problem solving skills to one day be able to help society at large. I enjoy playing and watching sports. I also enjoy cooking, as it is, just like software development, a form of art. *draft*
